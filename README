 Shape. (2022) Denys E. S. Santos, Kaline Coutinho, Thereza A. Soares. J. Chem. Inf. Model.

 SuAVE: A Tool for Analyzing Curvature-Dependent Properties in Chemical Interfaces

 DESCRIPTION: 

 The surface assessment via grid evaluation (SuAVE) software was developed to account 
 for the effect of curvature in the calculations of structural properties of chemical 
 interfaces regardless of the chemical composition, asymmetry, and level of atom coarseness. 
 It employs differential geometry techniques, enabling the representation of chemical 
 surfaces as fully differentiable. 


 This code has been writen by Denys E. S. Santos, Conceptualized by Thereza A. Soares 
 and Revised by Kaline Coutinho. 


 INSTALLATION:

 SuAVE can be compiled in any operational system, is distributed free of charge and
 it is maintained by a single developer. If you experience code issues, we kindly 
 request you to contact us at e-mail: suave.biomat@gmail.com

 ---------------------------------

 Prerequisites for installation:
   
 -> gfortran installed

 -> library libquadmath installed 

 ----------------------------------

 In order to install the programs and enjoy your analysis time, please follow the steps 
 below:

 1- Download the code:

    -> From GitHub web Page (https://github.com/SuAVE-Software/source) 
       clone the repository through the following commmand:

       $ git clone https://github.com/SuAVE-Software/source.git

    -> Dowload the compiled version from SuAVE Web Page 
       (https://www.biomatsite.net/suave-software)

 2- Compile the source code:

 If you downloaded the compiled version you just need to insert the files on a 
 convenient path in order to be run. If you downloaded the source code, please compile
 it by the use of any FORTRAN compiler. See below an example of how to compile SuAVE source 
 with gfortran:

      $ gfortran s_area.f90 -o s_area 

 The use of flags -O2 or -O3 is well accepted by this compiler and the code. It will be 
 helpful for extracting the best performance of SuAVE. 

 SuAVE version 2.0.0 is also able to use OpenMP parallelization. To do so, the user has to 
 insert the following command line:

       $ gfortran s_area.f90 -o s_area -fopenmp

 Once the user has compiled the source code or downloaded the compiled version of SuAVE Web
 Page, the code can be used. We suggest the following protocol to install the binaries and better
 take advantage of the SuAVE tools:

 1- Enter as super-user:

 2- Create the program directory:

    mkdir /usr/local/suave

 3- Move the programs:

    sudo mv s_* /usr/local/suave

 4- Insert the following directives in the .bash_profile file:

    export SUAVE=/usr/local/suave
    export PATH=$SUAVE:$PATH

 5- Update the bash

    source .bash_profile

    or

    source .bashrc

 6- Have fun with your analysis


 USAGE:

 A classical use for most of SuAVE tools is exemplified below for s_densph:

 Usage: s_densph -in file.pdb -ind1 file1.ndx -ind2 file2.ndx -dens dens.ndx
 
 file.pdb ---- atomic coordinates in PDB format

 file.ndx ---- index file containing user-selected atoms used to fit the grid points to 
 the chemical surface.

 dens.ndx ---- index file containing user-selected atoms used to calculate density profile.
 

 Options:
 
 -bin             defines the number of rectangular partition bins along the phi- and 
                  psi-angles
 
 -grid            generates a PDB file containing the grid points used in the fitting 
                  for the last frame in the trajectory file.
 
 -rmsd            calculates the RMSD between the fitted grid and the selected atoms in the 
                  index files. This estimates how precisely is the grid surface fitted to the
                  chemical surface throughout the trajectory file.
 
 -coarse          generates a coarse grid over the surface index atoms from which a finer grid 
 		  will be generated. This is recommended for surfaces defined by atoms which 
		  greatly fluctuate throughout the trajectory. 
 
 -begin           first frame to use in the calculations
 
 -end             last frame to use in the calculations
 
 -skip            number of trajectory frames to be skipped during the analysis 
 
 -slices          defines the number of slices along the axis normal to the system used 
 		  to calculate the density profile
 
 -rough           percentage of the original surface roughness the user wants to keep 
 		  (1.0 by default, meaning 100%)
 
 -help            prints HELP information and quits
